 initial commit

A tree can refer to one or more "blob" objects, each corresponding to a file. In addition, a tree can also refer to other tree objects, thus creating a directory hierarchy. You
can examine the contents of any tree using ls-tree (remember that a long enough initial portion of the SHA-1 will also work):

 $ git ls-tree 92b8b694
 100644 blob 3b18e512dba79e4c8300dd08aeb37f8e728b8dad    file.txt

Thus we see that this tree has one file in it. The SHA-1 hash is a reference to that fileâ€™s data:

 $ git cat-file -t 3b18e512
 blob

A "blob" is just file data, which we can also examine with cat-file:

 $ git cat-file blob 3b18e512
 hello world

three


git add  - creates a git blob object
 git add did was store a new blob and then put a reference to it in the index file

git commit  - creates a git tree object which has the previous commits info and the latest file added
So by default git commit uses the index to create the commit, not the working tree; the "-a" option to commit tells it to first update the index with all changes in the working
       tree.


.git/HEAD - will point to .git/refs/heads/<>
 all these are pointed to some git commit object
